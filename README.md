# MADE.NET

MADE.NET is a toolkit of easy-to-use extensions, helpers, and controls to make app development easier for .NET developers.

Whether you're building an ASP.NET Core Web API or a native UI application with Uno Platform, MADE.NET has something for everyone.

MADE.NET has been built on common code from projects built by the MADE team, and is now a home for all those bits of code that you know you will reuse in another project!
